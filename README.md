# Features
- Cross-platform
- Fast scanning speed
- Ultra fast rescan
- Optional calling ffmpeg functions natively for even more speed
- Finds duplicate videos / images based on similarity
- Windows, Linux and MacOS GUI

# Binaries

[Daily build](https://github.com/0x90d/videoduplicatefinder/releases/tag/3.0.x) (You need to download FFmpeg and FFprobe yourself, see below! Please note the attachments of this release are automatically created and replaced on every new commit.)


# Requirements

#### FFmpeg & FFprobe:

#### Windows user:
Get latest package from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html I recommend the full (GPL) shared version. If you want to use native ffmpeg binding you **must** use the shared version.

Extract ffmpeg and ffprobe into the same directory of VDF.GUI.dll or into a sub folder called `bin`. Or make sure it can be found in `PATH` system environment variable

#### Linux user:
Installing ffmpeg:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
Open terminal in VDF folder and execute `./VDF.GUI`
You may need to set execute permission first `sudo chmod 777 VDF.GUI`

#### MacOS user:
Install ffmpeg / ffprobe using homebrew

Open terminal in VDF folder and execute `./VDF.GUI` or if you have .NET installed `dotnet VDF.GUI.dll`
You may get a permission error. Open system settings of your Mac, go to `Privacy & Security` and then `Developer Tools`. Now add `Terminal` to the list.
